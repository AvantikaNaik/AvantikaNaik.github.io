Hello! It's been a few days and I'm back with more information about CMU's campus. 


### Day 3 + 4

Time is starting to blend together with no classes. I'm having a blast meeting new friends and people from my floor. The food is also good! We went back to ABP, and I've slowly been going through my stored food rather than buying new stuff. I did have my first bad food experience on Wednesday, at the Underground. Their soup de jour was rather plain, with weird cheese and soggy bread in the soup!! But the sandwish wasn't bad, and the pudding I got for dessert was delicious! My friends also got the ultimate brownie and they had nothing bad to say (except that it was too big). 

We've been doing a lot of exploring the campus and walking around. I think we've enetered through almost every enterence in Gates, Newell, Porter. We haven't gone down to the far side near the Hill, so maybe tomorrow? Let me know if I should vlog my journey!
