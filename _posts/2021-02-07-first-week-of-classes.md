It's been officially one week of classes for my first spring semester here at CMU. I feel like I've been living here on campus a lot longer than I really have, which is I guess in a way beneficial. I did my laundry, went out to eat, and even made actual friends. My avergae daily routine has been formed, though I'm still learning how to balance human interaction with schoolwork. 

Unlike being at home, being on campus means I have a lot more to deal with outside of pure academics. I have to study a lot more since my classes are harder, but I also have to manage the inner workings of independent daily life. From figuring out when to eat and who to eat with, to replying to texts from my virutal friends, to even managing the bathroom and shower schedule on my floor, life has gotten a lot more complex. 

It's not a bad way of living, and I can feel myself becoming better at multitasking and planning ahead. One thing I have noticed is that it's hard to switch into the super focused mode that I was in last semester, probably because of the long winter break and the overload of new humans around me. But I'm getting back into the workflow now!
