Hello! Welcome to my first official blog post that's not a test welcome post!!! 
I'm currently coming to you live from my dorm in Pittsburgh, PA. Although I've been
in modified quarantine, I've gone around the campus (safely) with my floor pod to 
pick up food. Here's my thoughts on all the places we've been so far :)

### Day 1

My first official day of quaratine, Sunday, I ate breakfast with my parents (if my RA is reading this, this is 100% a joke). We went to a small crepe place called Cafe Moulin in Shadyside. Although slightly pice for a college student, it was good (especially the Alaska crepe, which is worth the price). For lunch, I ate on campus with my RA and the one other girl who had move in. We ate at Au Bon Pain, a place that I've been to in MA a few times. ABP, as it's colloquially called, was nothing special but it wasn't bad. I got a chicken avocado wrap and a coffee (not good). For dinner, we went to Schatz, where they had a build your own burger and salad. I ate only the burger (the salad is still in my fridge as of now) but it was fine. Nothing special once again. All in all, the food has been good, but not great or spectacular. 

### Day 2

Monday started off with some leftovers. We had gone to Thai and Noodle Outlet Saturday night and I wanted to finish it. The pad thai was very good (10/10) and I had a spicy of 5, which was spicy enough but not overwhelming. I also locked myself out my accident because I had to clean my plate. But once I got back in,  my pod and I went to the Exchange, where I ordered a custom hot sandwich. It was a good sandwich, but I was expecting more from an esteemed place such as this. Perhaps another combo will be better? Only time will tell. I still have lots of leftovers in my fridge but I still am considering going out to dinner in order to bond with my floormates and make some friends. I'll catch you next time on Food for Thoughts From Quarantine!
